# Developer Kickstart Module 4: DML Operations

This repository is part of the Developer Kickstart Module 4 curriculum at Cloud Code Academy. It's designed to help beginner Salesforce developers learn and practice the fundamental operations of the Data Manipulation Language (DML) in Apex. The focus is on the Insert, Update, Upsert, and Delete operations, all of which are essential in manipulating Salesforce data.

## Goals of the Practice
Through this practice repository, you'll gain foundational knowledge about:
- Understanding the different types of DML operations in Apex (Insert, Update, Upsert, and Delete).
- How to use DML operations to create, update, and delete records in Salesforce.
- The structure and usage of Salesforce standard objects like Account, Contact, Opportunity, and Lead.
- How to handle bulk data operations in Apex.
- Understanding the concept of governor limits in Salesforce and how to write efficient, bulkified Apex code.

This foundational knowledge will prepare you for more advanced topics in Salesforce development, such as exception handling, asynchronous Apex, and trigger development. The curriculum includes practical examples with Salesforce standard objects to provide hands-on experience with DML operations.
## Note
Certain test methods related to the Book and Person classes are currently commented out and will need to be uncommented and deployed once the relevant classes are set up.
